            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
            Hoodiehub began in Los Angeles when three college friends bonded over one simple truth:
            <strong>hoodies make everything better.</strong> What started as a shared love for comfort
            turned into an idea — that hoodies shouldn’t just be for lazy days or cold nights, but could
            be worn on any occasion, in any style.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the start, we’ve focused on creating a wide range of designs that fit every mood and
            moment — from classic everyday pieces to bold, statement hoodies. But comfort alone wasn’t
            enough. We knew our mission also had to care for the planet we all share. That’s why Hoodiehub
            has always used eco-friendly materials and sustainable practices in everything we make.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the heart of our brand is a simple goal: to bring comfort to others. We believe that when
            you feel good, you can be your best self — and that begins with what you wear.
            </p>
